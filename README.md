# Getting started

Remember to work in the "addon" branch I've created so that we don't pollute the master branch. first you will have to do:

```
git remote add group5 https://github.com/csc302-2016-spring/group5.git
git fetch group5
```

so that the branch "group5/addon" will be our "master" for the addon development


for team collaboration, remember to do all your work in a local branch then do a pull request so that we can merge it on "group5/addon"


## Testing the addon
Do as stated here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#Testing_it_out

### tl;dr
Open "about:debugging" in Firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select your manifest.json file.
