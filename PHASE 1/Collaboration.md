## Team collaboration & compentency  
We have made a Doodle to determine everyone's [availability](http://doodle.com/poll/i8thc3q7krzchde4).  

Although no one has experience with addons/extensions, everyone has done web development before and is competent in it. So we should have no trouble learning.

## Roles and decisions 

Each member will be assigned a fair portion of the project to develop, preferably areas where they are are strong at. Decisions will be made by the consensus of the group. During our meetings, members will suggest an idea and other group members will give feedback and vote. For example, during our idea brainstorm, members listed their idea on the Google doc sheet and the group narrowed the topics down by functionality and practicality. Then we voted on the remaining ideas and the one with most votes was the idea proposed for our project.
    
## Meetings and future meetings

After we’ve assembled our group, we decided to brainstorm together in order to solve specific problems that poeople encounter during their web search. Each member individually generated as many ideas to solve a problem they encountered as possible, in writing. After a given period of time, each of us presented our ideas, and each of the ideas of the presenter are recorded in a google doc. The group members can ask the presenter to clarify the ideas after all group members have completed their presentations, the recorded ideas are discussed and criticized in order to improve them. After the group discussion, each of us are asked to rank the ideas and vote for the idea that is the most feasible and effective that can be done within the 4 weeks time frame.  

We meet about twice a week, one on our facebook group chat and a physical meeting at Bahen after lecture, and each time we designate specific roles to each member to ensure that we are on the right track and have enough work finished so that we are not pressed for time.We used Google Docs to host our meetings, which is convenient and efficient for the team. We also used Doodle to help us organize our meeting schedules and set up a time that is convenient for all of us to meet.  Moreover, we review each other’s work and suggest further modifications if necessary, so everyone can have a clear picture of our team’s progress. 

Our meeting methodology seems to work well so far, we will continue to host a facebook meeting and a physical meeting each week to discuss our teamwork. 

Refer to [Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/i8thc3q7krzchde4) and [Meeting Minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzzqHXFLxSxRMmB85BZm7GcnI4PymkBYQCtCnG2btMs/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

## Future collaboration

In terms of collaborating our code, we will use GitHub as our version control. We will divide our work into separate components so that each member would work on individual parts. By doing this, we try our best to avoid situations where members would have to wait for other members to complete their component before being able to proceed. In addition, there won’t be a redundant overlap in work where two or more members are concurrently working on the same feature. However, if there are components that relate to each other, members responsible for these parts would collaborate and work with each other.

We will make frequent GitHub code commits so that we can always see each other’s code. This is useful for when different pieces of code need to interact with each other. We will be able to see how the functionality of different components are implemented and tailor our code to suit it. Also, if people need a certain component to be completed before they can proceed, frequent commits would be useful to see progress. If there are any components that turn out to be too difficult, we would put more resources towards it by assigning multiple team members to it. Members can also just simply contribute to the code if they see something that they would like to add or fix. We would be able to review each other’s code to ensure the best quality.

Another tool we will use is Google Docs for our brainstorming, meeting notes, and text deliverables. Google Docs allows for concurrent reading and editing so we would be able to view our documents in real time as we brainstorm or have meetings. And because it is a shared document, we will always have each other’s work in front of us so we can tailor our report contributions to each other. Regarding collaboration of text deliverables, we will assign equal sections to each member of the group and read over each other’s work so that our final report will be a product of our entire group’s effort.
